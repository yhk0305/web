<p><p style="margin-top:45px;">People with bipolar disorders have extreme and intense emotional states that occur at distinct times,
called mood episodes. These mood episodes are categorized as manic, hypomanic or depressive.
People with bipolar disorders generally have periods of normal mood as well. Bipolar disorders can be treated, and people with
these illnesses can lead full and productive lives.</p>
