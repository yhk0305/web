<h2>What Is Anorexia?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/anorexia-nervosa" target=_blank
  title= "Anorexia definition by APA">Anorexia</a></strong> is illnesse in which the people experience severe disturbances
  in their eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions.
  People with eating disorders typically become pre-occupied with food and their body weight.</p>

<p><p style="margin-top:45px;">In many cases, eating disorders occur together with other psychiatric disorders
like anxiety, panic, obsessive compulsive disorder and alcohol and drug abuse problems.
New evidence suggests that heredity may play a part in why certain people develop eating disorders,
but these disorders also afflict many people who have no prior family history.
Without treatment of both the emotional and physical symptoms of these disorders, malnutrition,
heart problems and other potentially fatal conditions can result. However, with proper medical care,
those with eating disorders can resume suitable eating habits, and return to better emotional and psychological health.</p>
